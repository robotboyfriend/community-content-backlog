# Creating outline of your article

You decided to write about something awesome and share it with the world. Cool! The best start is to actually shape what you want to write about and who is going to be your audience. You can take a look below and try to answer a few questions about your future contribution, or just skip to the actual outline.

## Topic & Motivation

**Theme / Topic**

- What do you want to write about?
- What should people take away from your article?

**Target role**

- Who will gain the greatest benefit from your article?
- Is it a developer, solution architect, support engineer or someone completely different?

**Transformation**

- When your target audience reads your article, what should they start doing differently?
- Should they use a different approach to known problems?
- Will they learn from your mistakes?

## Outline

### Teaser

In the teaser of your article try to set out the problem you're about to solve. Explain why this problem is a problem and how your audience can relate to it. Be yourself and if you feel like adding a comment about your own experience, do it.

### Expectations

Right after the teaser it's the right place to set expectations. Readers should understand what will the take away from reading your article. They can learn from your experience, learn about new technologies or tools, or they can get a boilerplate to speed up their development using specific technology stack. This way you show your readers you value their time and they will get something in return for their investment.

If you're not sure about wording in this part of your article, just use bullet points.

### Content

Now it's time for the actual content. Write down all the things you want to write about. Do not think about the structure yet, just put down all the things you want your readers to know about.

Take a look at this example of ideas related to Apollo and GraphQL article:

- explain what is GraphQL
- explain what is Apollo
- why is the tightly coupling of components and their backend code a problem
- why is the transfer of knowledge to a new developer going to be a problem
- why should they care about maintaining their code
- how can they generate data model schema
- how can they define queries and mutations
- how do they put it all together
- which tools should they use
- which JS frameworks can they use

Once you get all these ideas written down, you can organize them into a few sections of your future article:

1. Introduce the problem
    - why is the tightly coupling of components and their backend code a problem
    - why is the transfer of knowledge to a new developer going to be a problem
    - why should they care about maintaining their code
2. What is GraphQL?
    - explain what is GraphQL
3. What is Apollo?
    - explain what is Apollo
    - how can they generate data model schema
    - how can they define queries and mutations
4. Putting it all together
    - how do they put it all together
    - which tools should they use
    - which JS frameworks can they use

You see some sections of the structure have more points than others. Take a closer look at each of the sections and make sure you did not miss any important aspect your readers should know about.
1. Introduce the problem
    - why is the tightly coupling of components and their backend code a problem
    - why is the transfer of knowledge to a new developer going to be a problem
    - why should they care about maintaining their code
2. What is GraphQL?
    - explain what is GraphQL
    - **compare to REST API and describe GraphQL benefits**
    - **enables separation of front-end and back-end**
3. What is Apollo?
    - explain what is Apollo
    - how can they generate data model schema
    - how can they define queries and mutations
    - **note the difference between Apollo client and Apollo server**
4. Putting it all together
    - how do they put it all together
    - which tools should they use
      - **briefly explain Express and React**
    - which JS frameworks can they use
    - **link the boilerplate on GitHub**

The structure looks better and better! Sleep on it and try to polish it a few more times until you're happy with the result.

The main point of all this work is to ensure a good flow of content. It shapes your ideas so that you don't jump from one to another and confuse your readers. It is a critical step as good flow will make sure that already hooked readers will continue reading till the end of the article.

## Summary

At the end of your article briefly summarize what you wrote about and emphasize the key takeaways. If there is more to read on the subject, make sure to include links to that content here and point the reader in the right direction.
